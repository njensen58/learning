// Will help me think more in a object oriented approach to design patterns.

// What are design patterns, where did they come from //

    // Came from an architect named Christopher Alexander after seeing patterns in
    // architecture.   Using Common problems to solve Common solutions.

    // Example Problems & Patterns:
        // On/Off traffic on highways === Cloverleaf interchanges
        // Pedestrian traffic === Sidewalks
        // Entry/Exit for public buildings === revolving doors.

    // Example of Development problems
        // Designing Service Layers === Module Pattern
        // Overly Complicated Object Interfaces (DOM) == Facade Pattern(Jquery)
        // Visibility Into State Changes === Observer Pattern


    // What makes a Pattern?
        // It solves a Common Problem and is Proven to work well as a solution across the board.
        // The solution is not obvious. ex. for loop is not a pattern, it's a simple solution
        // 9/10 a design pattern will describe a relationship
        // It has a significant human component

    // Design Patterns:
        // Allow developers to have a common vocabulary to use when working on problems.


// TYPES OF PATTERNS //
    // CREATIONAL:
        // Deal with the creation of new instances of an Object.
        1. CONSTRUCTOR PATTERN (specific to Javascript)
        2. MODULE PATTERN (specific to Javascript)
        3. FACTORY PATTERN
        4. SINGLETON PATTERN
    // STRUCTRUAL:
        // Deal with the make up of the actual objects themselves.
        1. DECORATOR PATTERN
        2. FACADE PATTERN
        3. FLYWEIGHT PATTERN
    // BEHAVIORAL:
        // Deal with how objects relate to each other and how they operate.
        1. COMMAND PATTERN
        2. MEDIATOR PATTERN
        3. OBSERVER PATTERN
