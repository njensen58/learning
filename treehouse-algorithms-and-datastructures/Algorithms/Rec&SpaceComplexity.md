Recursion runs in logorithmic time `O(log n)`:
- A recursive function is a function that calls itself
- a Base Case is the stopping condition

    - Python prefers an iterative solution over a recursive solution

- Tail recursion is when a function calls itself at the end of it's function declaration.
    - Python does not handle it as well so iterative is best.

Space Complexity 
- a measure of how much working storage, or extra storage, is needed as a particular algorithm grows
    - Measured in the worse case scenario just like Time complexity using Big O notation

    - Space complexity is not concerned with the amount of data, it's concerned with the amount of storage required.
